# Rumor-Detection
This is a machine learning project to detect rumors across the social media platforms like whatsapp , twitter and facebook . This program will work in the same manner as any spam detector in a software works. Using the rumor detection dataset we first train our machine learning program  and then we test it to see its accuracy . The more we feed the data the more its will it will get accurate . 

The typical rumour resolution task flow starts by first identifying whether a given piece or a given set of information is a rumour or not. This phase is termed as rumour detection. At this point the input is basically a raw chunk of data which is circulating in public domain and such a topic might or might not be a rumour. If the news event/report turns out to be true news, then itâ€™s automatically discarded since its veracity or truth value is known to us. But on the other hand if the classification of the information turns out to be a rumour, then this data is fed to the next phase which is called as rumour tracking. This part of the whole architecture will collect and cluster out relevant topics, discussions, and posts related to the identified rumour
